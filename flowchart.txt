Detection
----------

9. Importing the packages
10. Exploring the dataset 
	- Reading the image
	- plotting the image
11. Image Processing
	- converting to blob object
	- defining the class
	- declaring the bounding box
	- convert the array to a numpy array
12. Loading the pre-trained model
	- reading the network layers
	- extract the output layers
13. Image processing
	- appending the image - annotation file and images
	- converting bgr to rgb
	- creating the mask
	- resizing the image
14. Data Augmentation
	- randoming the image
	- rotating the image
	- transforming the image
15. Installing the packages required 
16. Processing the Data based on Yolo family
17. Building the model 

	- Yolo v5x6
	- Yolo v5s6
	- Yolo v8n
	- Yolo v9n
		
18. Training the model
19. Dumping the best model for detecting the abnormalities further


FrontEnd
--------

20. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
21. For the frontend we used the data for classifying and detecting
22. User uploads an image
	- Classification
	- Detection
23. The given input is preprocessed for classifying and detecting
24. Trained model is used for classifying and detecting
25. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different Transfer Learning models for classify the Brain tumor and detecting the brain tumor using yolo family,
As an extension we have applied NASNetMobile + NASNetLarge for analysis the dataset, along with the we applied Yolo family for detecting the abnormalities,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
